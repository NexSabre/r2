Request-Replay is simple tool to record your requests on specific target and later replay it to automate your daily tasks

This version is still Work In Progress. Record/Replay function should work with no problems, but it is lack of features. 

## TODO
- Implement an option to parse arguments ex `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?q=title:DNA`. Actual version will pass 
everything on the right side of the `?` and save a file under `search`.
